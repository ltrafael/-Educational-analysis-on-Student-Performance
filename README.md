# Educational analysis on Student Performance

This is an educational analysis made on a public dataset called Student Performance. In it, I explore and learn about multiple techniques for feature selection, scaling, encoding and other feature engineering solutions. I do this by not only applying all these techniques on the dataset but also explaining how most of them work.

In this notebook, you can get all the information on how to access this dataset and what all the variables represent. If you have any observations, criticism or suggestions, please feel free to contact me via the e-mail rafaellt3@gmail.com.
